# shipmap

USS MT HOOD  map of member locations by zip/city

1. reads adresses from sql database

2. geocode to get lat lon

3. uses google map api to map with grouping

node, express, mysql

My plan is for this to become the core of an app where you can find and contact shipmates you served with in the past 

For now the database is only a list of cities, the full app will have encryption in place and 
let users provide as much or as little as they want.
